# ViT-for-car-detection

This repository consists of an ipynb notebook which contains the entire code for ViT for Car Detection. 
The dataset used was [Car Object Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/car-object-detection)
ViT have great performance with big dataset size. This dataset consists of 1001 images. 
The model is expected to achieve more accuracy for detection part on increasing the dataset size.


*Note: The ipynb does not consist of result images due to file size issues.*
